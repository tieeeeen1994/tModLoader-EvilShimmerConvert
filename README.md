I can't find a mod where we can naturally exchange crimson and corruption. There are mods that can naturally make crimson and corruption for you, but you can't easily spread them. On single player worlds, I get bored stiff trying to wait for a spread the other evil biome from the surface to underground.

So this mod introduces a way to shimmer some evil materials, items and blocks to the other evil variant.

- Evil Ice Block
- Evil Sand Blocks
- Evil Stone Blocks
- Evil solutions for Clentaminator
- Evil Seeds
